  getFormulaArray(populationSize)
  getFormulaArray(populationSize, parent1Index, parent2Index)
  Parameters
  ----------
  - populationSize: an int specifying the number of images you want to generate.
    Vic wants the code to be written this way for extensibility, but we'll just
    be passing the number 4 for now.
  - parent1Index, parent2Index: ints specifying the index of an image in an array,
    used to identify the parents for the next generation.
    No parents are provided for the first generation, hence the overload.
  Return value
  ------------
  Both methods return a String[][] array containing the number of subarrays
  specified by populationSize.
  Each subarray consists of 3 formula strings (one for each color channel
  in the image - R,G,B).
